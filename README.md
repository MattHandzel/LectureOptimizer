#### Goals

- [ ] Remove all parts of the lecture that do not give the user information. (silences, technical difficulties, filler words)
- [ ] Remove accents
- [ ] Improve the speakers tone, pacing, general oral quality
- [ ] Use learning theory to enforce good learning practices (such as intelligent breaks, active learning)
- [ ] Give lecturers the same speech qualty as professional speakers
- [?] Consume lectures regardless of language

#### Features

- [x] Speeding up silent parts of the lecture
- [x] Speed up lecture
- [ ] Read text from slides and outputs it
- [ ] Improve audio quality by denoising, this actually improves audio quality quite significantly. A 1hr20 minute lecture before audio denoising takes 20 minutes to process, while it takes 1 hr to process with denoising.
- [>] Cut out filler words from lecture
- [ ] Accent, filler word, and crappy explanation filter.
- [ ] Incorporate captions and transcripts
- [?] Potentially remove a lot of the frames if the video is just a slideshow. (reduce file size, increase processing speed)
- [ ] Transcript generation with whisper (1h20m video took 2h9m)
- [ ] TTS first iteration took 1h5m for 30 minutes of lecture
- [ ] TTS with 12 workers takes 4m38s for 5m30s of audio!

#### TODO:

Retain audio that is not related to voice (music, sound effects, etc.)
Enable watermark on whole audio
Test to see how good whisper and RNNoise do when silence is severely cut out. -> 10% performance improvement

See if RNNoise -> whisper gives better results

```py
    TARGET_SPEED = 1.0  # TODO: See if changing this parameter gives better results then explicitly changing the talking speed.
```

When improving the lecture transcript, take the image from the lecture video as input for more/better data.

Find where questions are being asked and tag them. Use this later down in the lecture optimizer

How to make output text to speech sound more lively/realistic?

"You can read those papers" is pronouned "You can red those papers"

Improve the Openvoice library so audios can be passed in memory instead of reading and writing to/from disk

#### Pipeline

Input lecture video -> denoise the video, increase audio quality
(maybe removing silences will help whisper, needs to be tested)
Whisper extracts transcript
From transcript identify parts of text irrelevant to the material -> remove those
From transcript, identify and remove filler words (whisper might not detect them, good!)
Might have to clean up the transcript here as it won't be perfect. (i.e. some words captured might not make sense)
Change the transcript so a complete thought is spoken every time. Right now, whisper splits it up somewhat aprbirarily. Also break up longer sentences to make it easier for tts packing

```
1314520	1316080	to try to move one terabyte of data
1316080	1318420	from the U.S. east coast to the U.S. west coast.
1318640	1320500	It took two weeks to transfer.
1321040	1322400	The network is a bit faster today,
1322740	1325140	but essentially not a whole lot faster.
1325280	1327800	So essentially it means it's very hard to move the data.
```

More cool things can be done here! Improving explanations, rewording things, removing redundant information, adding content :)
From the transcript, use a voice clonning AI to read the transcript from the person's voice (accent removal), or read it using an AI voice
Speed up the voice clonned AI audio to the desired speed.
Create many audio segments, they might not be the same length as before, if that is the case, take the video chunk that was played during the time segments, and then speed it up to match the audio segment's length. There are edge cases and problems with this because of video. There might be off-by-one errors that accumulate, the video might get out of sync with the audio ðŸ˜­
Stitch audio and video segments together, and you should get an optimal lecture.

#### Remove text irrelevant to material:

Example, during a lecture the professor was asking the class about the lighting, wasting a whole minute of our time

```
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.440]  Hi, everyone.
[01:03.800 --> 01:04.540]  Ooh, loud.
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.240]  Let's figure out the lighting.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.840]  I'm going to give you three options for lighting.
[01:13.900 --> 01:14.680]  Let's see.
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.800]  This is option one.
[01:22.500 --> 01:23.880]  This is option two.
[01:25.560 --> 01:26.820]  Hey, not much difference.
[01:28.440 --> 01:29.720]  This is option three.
[01:31.000 --> 01:31.880]  Ooh.
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.020]  This is option four.
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.720]  Bad option.
[01:40.140 --> 01:41.620]  How many want option one?
[01:42.100 --> 01:42.600]  First one.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.520]  How many want option two?
[01:46.840 --> 01:48.100]  How many want option three?
[01:48.820 --> 01:50.000]  Three? All right.
[01:50.380 --> 01:50.860]  Okay.
[01:52.620 --> 01:53.320]  All right.
[01:53.420 --> 01:55.620]  You guys are in mood for a movie, eh?
[01:56.020 --> 01:56.380]  Okay.
[01:56.380 --> 01:56.480]  Okay.
```

"or even microservices [which is another buzzord that I did not define here]" -> "or even microservices". This is a good example of a sentence that is not relevant to the material, and can be removed.

```
4170260	4172100	to function as a
4172100	4172320	service
4172320	4172660	or even
4172660	4173260	microservices
4173260	4173720	which is another
4173720	4174220	buzzword
4174220	4174860	that I did not
4174860	4175300	define here
4175300	4176460	how efficiently
4176460	4176780	you do it
4176780	4177160	if you do it
4177160	4177480	right
```

Whisper seems to natively take out some of the "phoneme" filler words (such as "um, ah")

it's a very open area and there is a very there's a scarity of education resources in that area.

```
4220820	4221080	right
4221080	4221980	it's a very
4221980	4222620	open area
4222620	4223620	and there
4223620	4224060	is a very
4224060	4225400	there's a scarcity
4225400	4225860	of education
4225860	4226280	resources
4226280	4227280	in that area
```

Lectures are filled with this rambling. The above paragraph instead could be "Today, we're discussing cloud computing, a recent buzzword. We'll unearth what it's all about and attempt to define the term."

```

148460	155180	So, today we are discussing cloud computing, which is this new buzzword that has been around for a few years. And so, we are going to try to unearth what cloud computing is all about. We will try to kind of sort of define the term cloud computing.
```

Interactive Q&A segments ("Yes, you had a question...") are jarring without audience context.
Fix: Integrate questions into the narrative (e.g., "A common question is: What defines a rack? A rack is...").

```
1759720	1760700	that run inside of them.
1761800	1762760	Yes, you had a question.
1762760	1771020	What do I mean by a rack?
1771120	1772540	Yes, a rack is a collection
1772540	1773420	of computing nodes
```

Add Transitions: Use phrases like "Next," "In contrast," or "Historically," to guide flow.

#### Edge cases

- If a movie is being played without any audio, this program will zoom through it at a very fast speed.
  Maybe this could be detected by seeing how often the image changes from timestep to timestep and identify any videos playing
- If this is a lecture video where the professor rights on the board, there might be problems with taking the video and speeding it up/doing slideshow detection
